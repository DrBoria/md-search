## Keyboard Shortcuts

The extension includes several helpful keyboard shortcuts to enhance your workflow:

| Shortcut (Windows/Linux) | Shortcut (macOS) | Command              | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F`           | `Cmd+Shift+F`    | Find                 | Opens the search panel and focuses the find input            |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H`           | `Cmd+Shift+H`    | Replace              | Opens the search panel and focuses the replace input         |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C`           | `Cmd+Shift+C`    | Copy All Matches     | Copies all found matches to clipboard, separated by newlines |
| `Ctrl+Shift+X`           | `Cmd+Shift+X`    | Cut All Matches      | Cuts all found matches and copies them to clipboard          |
| `Ctrl+Shift+V`           | `Cmd+Shift+V`    | Paste to All Matches | Replaces all found matches with clipboard content            |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z`           | `Cmd+Shift+Z`    | Revert               | Returns to previous state, buffer size is 1 step             |

The copy/cut/paste operations work with multiple matches at once, allowing you to:

- Copy hundreds of matches with a single keystroke
- Cut multiple occurrences across files and paste them elsewhere
- Replace multiple occurrences with either single or multiple values from the clipboard

These shortcuts are active when the search panel has focus.

> **Note:** If keyboard shortcuts don't work, they might conflict with shortcuts from other extensions. You can customize them in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts settings (File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts).

> **Performance Note:** When working with a large number of files or matches, operations like Copy All Matches, Cut All Matches, or Paste to All Matches may experience a slight delay. This is normal as the extension processes all matches across multiple files.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.60.0 or higher
